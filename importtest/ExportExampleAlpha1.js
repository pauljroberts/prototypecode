In 2014\/15, EPS made efficiency savings in excess of \u00a3115m. For prescribers, efficiencies include bulk signing repeat prescriptions, the ability to cancel prescription items and the reduction of lost prescriptions. Dispensers no longer need to transcribe paper prescription information. Standardised information reduces queries and the likelihood of the wrong medication being dispensed and makes the end of month claim process more efficient. Prescriptions are sent straight to the dispenser of choice, minimising patient collection time. EPS is now live at 6,128 GP practices (78.9%) and 11,595 pharmacies (98.6%). 18.1 million patients have chosen an EPS pharmacy and more than 42% of all prescriptions are EPS transmitted.<\/p><p>Spine connects clinicians and patients to essential national services including demographic data confirmation and updates, EPS, Summary Care Record and the e-Referral Service - allowing the delivery of safe and effective care to patients. The final stage in this ambitious programme saw the transfer of the whole of Spine from external to in-house management. The 18-month transition project to entirely rebuild and redevelop the Spine was achieved without disrupting the service it provides to 28,000 organisations and enabled the secure transfer of almost 150TB of data, including the demographic details of 80m people. It is believed to be the biggest IT project of its kind.<br \/>The HSJ Awards recognise and promote the finest achievements in the NHS, and showcase them to the service's most influential leaders.<\/p><p>HSCIC Chief Operating officer, Rob Shaw, said: &quot;Having two projects shortlisted for an HSJ Award is a major success for the HSCIC. It is particularly impressive to be nominated in this category as much of what we do as an organisation is aimed at providing cutting edge information technology to support clinical services and, ultimately, patients. The nominations recognise both the innovative nature of these projects, and the fact they deliver value for money to the taxpayer, which saves the NHS valuable funds. Whatever the outcome, both teams should be proud of their excellent work and we wish them luck on 15 April.&quot;<\/p><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"CTA\"--><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"COMPONENT\"--><!--\/textbody-->","ARTICLEDISPLAYEDATE":"May, 05 2115 11:23:28 +0100","ARTICLEDISPLAY":"on","ARCHIVEDATE":"May, 05 2115 11:23:28 +0100","Media":[],"ARTICLEDISPLAYDATE":"May, 05 2016 11:23:28 +0100"}

It provides context for understanding mental health and supports clinical research and funding by examining the prevalence of mental health conditions and behaviours and how they vary by factors such as gender, age, ethnic group and marital status.<\/p><p>The report also showed, for the people surveyed:<\/p><ul><li>Women were more likely than men to have reported CMD symptoms. One in five women (19 per cent) had reported CMD symptoms, compared with one in eight men (12 per cent). Women were also more likely than men to report severe symptoms of CMD - 10 per cent of women surveyed reported severe symptoms compared to 6 per cent of men.<\/li><li>The gap in reported rates of CMD symptoms between young men and women has increased since the first time the survey was carried out. In 1993, 19 per cent of 16 to 24 year old women surveyed reported symptoms of CMD compared to 8 per cent of 16 to 24 year old men. In 2014, CMD symptoms were almost three times as commonly reported by women of that age range (26 per cent) than men (9 per cent).<\/li><li>Medication was the most common form of mental health treatment for all conditions assessed within the survey and was reported as being taken by 10 per cent of all people interviewed. 3 per cent reported receiving psychological therapy. Medication was more common than psychological therapy both in those with current symptoms of CMD (31 per cent with medication and 12 per cent with therapies) and in those without current symptoms. (6 per cent with medication and 1 per cent with therapies).<\/li><li>&nbsp;Of those people reporting severe CMD symptoms there has been an increase in the proportion who reported accessing psychological therapy from 13 per cent in 2000 to 15 per cent in 2007 and 18 per cent in 2014.<\/li><\/ul><p>The report is the latest in a series of surveys which took place previously in 1993, 2000 and 2007. It includes mental health data which are not collected anywhere else and complements the wide range of statistics routinely published on mental health by NHS Digital.<\/p><p>The report features chapters on: common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and self-harm and comorbidity.<\/p><p>Information published in the report includes:<\/p><p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder<sup>7<\/sup>:<\/p><ul><li>About a third (31 per cent) of adults surveyed reported having experienced at least one traumatic event.<\/li><li>Among women, the likelihood of screening<sup>8 <\/sup>positive for PTSD was high among 16 to 24 year olds (13 per cent) and then declined with age. In men, the rate remained relatively consistent for age groups between 16 and 64, (between 4 and 5 per cent for these age groups) only declining in much later life.<\/li><\/ul><p>Bipolar<sup>9<\/sup> (included for the first time):<\/p><ul><li>Before APMS 2014, bipolar disorder had not been assessed in the UK general population.<\/li><li>Overall, 2 per cent of those surveyed screened positive for bipolar disorder, with similar rates of around 2 per cent for both men and women.<\/li><li>Positive screening for bipolar disorder was more common in younger age-groups. 3 per cent of 16 to 24 year olds screened positive compared with less than 1 per cent of those aged 65 to 74. None of the participants aged 75 and over screened positive for bipolar disorder. These were small numbers of individuals and the rates for specific age groups in the overall population may vary from these, but the overall reduction of rate with age was found to be statistically significant.<\/li><\/ul><p>Suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and self-harm among those surveyed<sup>10<\/sup>:<\/p><ul><li>A fifth of adults (21 per cent) reported that they had thought of taking their own life at some point.<\/li><li>Overall, half of people who had attempted suicide had sought help after their most recent attempt (50 per cent).<\/li><li>The proportion of the population who report having self-harmed has increased from 2 per cent of 16 to 74 year olds in 2000 to 4 per cent in 2007, and 6 per cent in 2014. This increase is evident in both men and women and across age-groups.<\/li><li>One in four 16 to 24 year old women (26 per cent) surveyed has self-harmed, more than twice the rate than in young men (10 per cent). This mostly took the form of self-cutting.<\/li><\/ul><p>Comorbidity<sup>11<\/sup>:<\/p><ul><li>For the first time, the 2014 survey profiled comorbidity across mental disorders, chronic physical conditions, psychological wellbeing and mental disorder. The five chronic conditions considered were asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer and epilepsy.<\/li><li>There was an association between common mental disorders (CMD) and chronic physical conditions. Over a third (38 per cent) of people surveyed with severe CMD symptoms reported a chronic physical condition, compared with a quarter (25 per cent) of those with no or few symptoms of CMD.<\/li><li>The association between common mental disorder (CMD) and chronic physical conditions was evident for each of the chronic conditions examined. For example, people surveyed with severe symptoms of CMD were twice as likely to have asthma (15 per cent) as people with no or few symptoms (7 per cent).<\/li><\/ul><p>Read the full report at: <a href=\"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/pubs\/apmsurvey14\">http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/pubs\/apmsurvey14<\/a><\/p><h2>Notes to editors<\/h2><p>1.

Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.<\/p><p>3. The survey data were weighted to take account of selection probabilities and non-response, so that the results were representative of the household population aged 16 years and over. The results shown here and in the report reflect the responses received from people surveyed with this weighting applied.<\/p><p>4. The report is published every seven years. This is the fourth publication in the series. High quality screening and assessment tools are used and undiagnosed conditions are identified. Methods are kept comparable, so trends over time can be examined with surveys carried out in 1993, 2000, 2007 and 2014. A random sample of the household population is used, covering the whole adult age range and including people who do not use mental health services.<\/p><p>5. Common mental disorders (CMDs) comprise different types of depression and anxiety. The revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) has been used on every wave of the APMS series to assess six types of CMD: depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and CMD not otherwise specified (CMD-NOS). Many people meet the criteria for more than one CMD. The CIS-R is also used to produce a score that reflects overall severity of symptoms of CMD. The scores for each section are then summed to produce a total CIS-R score, which is an indication of the overall severity of symptoms. A CIS-R score of 0-5, is used to denote people with few or no symptoms. A CIS-R score of 18 or more denotes more severe or pervasive symptoms of a level very likely to warrant intervention such as medication or psychological therapy.<\/p><p>6. Fieldwork was carried out between May 2014 and September 2015 using a two-phase approach. First, phase interviews were carried out by NatCen Social Research interviewers including structured assessments and screening instruments for mental disorders, and questions about other topics, such as general health, service use, risk factors and demographics. Second, phase interviews were carried out by clinically-trained research interviewers employed by the University of Leicester. A sub-sample of phase one respondents was invited to take part in the second phase interview to permit assessment of psychotic disorder, attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and autism. The assessment of these conditions requires a more detailed and flexible interview than was possible at the first phase, and the use of clinical judgement in&nbsp;establishing a diagnosis. As for all surveys, it should be acknowledged that prevalence rates are only estimates. If everyone in the population had been assessed the rate may be higher or lower than the survey estimate. Confidence intervals are given for key estimates in the methods chapter (Chapter 14). For low prevalence disorders, relatively few positive cases were identified. Particular attention should be given to uncertainty around these estimates and to any subgroup analysis based on these small samples. All comparisons made here and in the report have been tested and only statistically significant differences are described.<\/p><p>7. This presents findings about the extent of trauma and of screening positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population. A positive screen did not mean that a disorder is necessarily present, only that there were sufficient symptoms to warrant further investigation. Traumatic events were defined as experiences that put a person -or someone close to them - at risk of serious harm or death e.g a natural disaster, a serious car accident, being raped, or a loved one dying by murder or suicide.<\/p><p>8. The use of validated mental disorder screens and assessments allows for identification of people with sub-threshold symptoms and those with an undiagnosed disorder. A positive screen only indicates that someone may have sufficient traits to warrant further and fuller investigation. Screen positive rates tend to be higher than actual rates of disorder. It should also be noted that the term 'screen' is used as a convention, and does not indicate that that the screening tests used in the survey are used as part of any national screening programme in England.<\/p><p>9. Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a common, lifelong, mental health condition characterised by recurring episodes of depression and mania. It is associated with significant impairment. Before APMS 2014, bipolar disorder had not been assessed in the UK general population.<\/p><p>10. This chapter provides nationally representative estimates of the prevalence of suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and self-harm, and trends in these since 2000. Their relationship to age, sex and other characteristics is described alongside findings on the methods and reasons reported for self-harming. Finally, results are presented on the help-seeking behaviour of people who have made a suicide attempt, and on the types of professional help received by those who have self-harmed.<\/p><p>11. Comorbidity refers to the presence of two or more conditions at the same time. Physical health conditions were measured by showing participants a list of health conditions and asking which a health professional had diagnosed them with. Five chronic conditions were considered. The identification of mental disorders followed the same approach as that in the mental disorder specific chapters. Mental wellbeing was assessed using the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), where a higher score indicates greater psychological wellbeing. Learning impairment was also included, assessed using the New Adult Reading Test (NART).<\/p><p>12.

Although I've now been with HSCIC for six months, I only&nbsp;recently joined the Digital Communications team to support the delivery of a brand new corporate website. So I'd like to say thank you to everyone who helped make that transition so smooth.<\/p><p>I've previously worked in digital marketing, but it's been clear from the offset that this project is going to pose some unique (and exciting) challenges -&nbsp;ones&nbsp;that we'll all&nbsp;need to work together to overcome. It's no secret that our current website isn't fit for purpose, so I'm really looking forward to seeing&nbsp;the brand new one&nbsp;come to life.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, with just a small team of seven in digital comms, something has got to give. With such a complex site, it can easily take 10 minutes to upload and edit a single file, and when you're tasked with uploading over 300 in a week (they really do save all the best jobs for the new guy!), it quickly adds up.<\/p><p>So, we won't be able to maintain the current level of changes to the old site. Going forward, only business critical changes will be made and only one member of the team will be dealing with queries each day. Of course, there's a pool of talented communications colleagues within programme teams and Marketing&nbsp;and Communications who will be able to support minor changes, but naturally some requests will have to be prioritised over others to create capacity.<\/p><p>And that's where you, our lovely colleagues, come in.<\/p><p>We really need your help in making the new corporate website project a success. This can be as simple as:<\/p><ul><li>questioning whether a change to the old website is really necessary<\/li><li>utilising the skills of other colleagues to help spread the workload<\/li><li>ensuring that all essential requests are accompanied by a fully completed web content approval form<\/li><li>thoroughly checking documents before submitting them for upload<\/li><li>giving as much notice as possible for any upcoming changes<\/li><\/ul><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>In the famous words of Bugsy Malone, &quot;You give a little love, and it all comes back to you...&quot; The more we can reduce updates to the old site (or help make them as quick as possible by following the tips above) the sooner we'll be able to start developing a shiny new website.<\/p><p>Be sure to look out for opportunities to be involved in the project through surveys, interviews, Show&nbsp;and Tells&nbsp;or Lunch&nbsp;and Learn sessions.

It doesn't matter if that thing is positive or negative, the important point is you're hearing a consistent message and seeing a pattern emerge. Once you can see patterns, you can start to build solutions.<\/p><p>The last couple of weeks have been a whirl of interviews with subject matter experts (the people who know what their part of the site is for) and users (the people who know what they want to do with the stuff that is on our site). We're now working out what patterns are emerging in what interviewees have said. Are the two groups thinking the same way? Do users feel like we are helping or hindering them? What do the subject matter experts want to achieve? These questions are starting to emerge really quickly.<\/p><p>We've recorded the interviews using WebEx and that decision looks like it was the right one. Although the recordings are long (around an hour each) they are packed with valuable information. Nothing is better than watching a user navigate round the site while they talk about what they are trying to do.<\/p><p>It's clear that some of our users have invested a lot of time in learning how to get the most from the site. Some of them really like it - although they do tend to stick to the part they know. Others have to dip in and out of different areas and they have been talking about inconsistencies in layout, not being able to identify the most up to date documents and useful material being buried under layers of information that we think is important, but they just see as a distraction.<\/p><p>These are all things that we had assumed were the case. But, now we've tested those assumptions, we have powerful evidence that we can play back to people in the business.<\/p><p>So, returning to those patterns. If different users are telling us, for example, that the first thing they look for are the latest updates on a service then that's a strong indication that we need to feature those in a consistent way. Written like that, it seems painfully obvious, but years of content build-up and little tweaks and changes to layout and navigation have accumulated in the website like barnacles on a ship's hull, making each part just that bit different. In some cases, more than a bit.<\/p><p>What we will now start to do is design some page layouts that we can use to test answers to these problems. These won't be finished, polished pages. We might even draw some on paper. The key thing is that we will test all of them with the users.<\/p><p>We'll work quickly, changing the designs as we go and as we get increasing clarity on what it is the users want to see. Best practice says we don't need a large number of users, but we do need to get representative samples. That's OK - we've been working hard on recruiting people who would like to get involved and, at a later stage, we'll also probably test some parts of the site with people who we literally invite in off the street.<\/p><p>The team are looking forward to this stage. Building pages and writing content will start to make the new site feel real and will give us more things to show the business too. It will make our regular show and tell sessions more exciting and will stimulate even more feedback and involvement.<\/p><p>Our next blog should show some examples of this<\/p><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"CTA\"--><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"COMPONENT\"--><!--\/textbody-->","ARTICLEDISPLAYEDATE":"July, 07 2115 12:10:48 +0100","ARTICLEDISPLAY":"on","ARCHIVEDATE":"July, 07 2115 12:02:53 +0100","Media":[{"Files":{"variant1":"t\/a\/binary_20strand_20data.jpg"},"TITLE":"binary%20strand%20data","KEYWORDS":"","DESCRIPTION":"Image","MEDIATYPEID":1,"MEDIAID":251,"MediaDirectory":"image","DISPLAY":"on","DISPLAYEDATE":"July, 07 2116 11:46:57 +0100","DISPLAYDATE":"July, 07 2016 11:46:57 +0100"}],"ARTICLEDISPLAYDATE":"February, 26 2016 12:10:48 +0000"}

The pharmacists and nurses we were interviewing kept saying how they went to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/forthepublic\">For the public<\/a> area of our site because they thought it would be easier to understand.<\/p><p>How sad is that? It seems our users in this session found the words on our site so complicated and off-putting that they're looking for a translation into normal English!<\/p><p>This got me thinking about something I find absolutely fascinating - the power of words. As a professional wordsmith I've always known the pen truly is mightier than the sword, but now there's increasing evidence to prove it.<\/p><p>For example, a fascinating case study popped into my inbox recently from the awesome <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk\/\">Behavioural Insights Team<\/a> who use to be the government's 'nudge unit'. These guys harness the power of words to influence people to do important things like give blood and fill in their tax returns. Their sharing some <a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQjExr\">evidence from the States<\/a> that found that changing the words on a text to &quot;You have been selected for a FREE doctor's apt&quot; encouraged twice as many people to sign up for a free health check.<\/p><p>I also stumbled across this slide from a training event I went to. Says it all I think. If ordinary people use 'cheap flights' then it's not rocket science to conclude that's the wording a website should use?<\/p><p>Yet using simple, clear language on a website is so often an uphill battle. Experts get into the habit of using technical language and somehow it's seen as 'dumbing down' to use plain English. In reality, it's always been best practice not to assume any knowledge on the part of the reader. It's also true that 'less is more' when it comes to words. As the mantra goes, KISS keep it simple stupid. Website users just want to information quickly - as the Steve Krug website usability bible says &quot;Don't Make Me Think.<\/p><p>So, that's one of the pitfalls we're aiming to avoid on the new corporate website and other digital outputs in future. It's enshrined in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/service-manual\/user-centred-design\/how-users-read.html\">Government Digital Service guidelines<\/a> that we're following in principle.<\/p><p>At the end of the day, using the shortest most meaningful language possible isn't just a 'nice to have' when it comes to effective digital communications - it's essential. As digital marketing guru <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThisIsSethsBlog\">Seth Godin<\/a> says &quot;Why waste a sentence saying nothing?&quot; And that's particularly the case as we move into a world where the success of organisations will rise or fall depending on what they say and how interesting it is rather than how much they spend on advertising.<\/p><p>So, words are powerful things and we're looking at how we can harness them more effectively for our organisation - watch this space for more information as our plans unfurl!<\/p><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"CTA\"--><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"COMPONENT\"--><!--\/textbody-->","ARTICLEDISPLAYEDATE":"July, 07 2115 12:15:02 +0100","ARTICLEDISPLAY":"on","ARCHIVEDATE":"July, 07 2115 12:02:53 +0100","Media":[{"Files":{"variant1":"o\/h\/86799017-03b3-49ce-ae3d-47d1a17bf394.jpg"},"TITLE":"86799017-03b3-49ce-ae3d-47d1a17bf394","KEYWORDS":"","DESCRIPTION":"Image","MEDIATYPEID":1,"MEDIAID":240,"MediaDirectory":"image","DISPLAY":"on","DISPLAYEDATE":"July, 07 2116 11:46:57 +0100","DISPLAYDATE":"July, 07 2016 11:46:57 +0100"}],"ARTICLEDISPLAYDATE":"March, 21 2016 12:15:02 +0000"}

Our vision is to harness the power of information and technology to make health and care better. As at 22 August 2016, NHS Digital was responsible for 93 active (currently published or planned for future release) series of Official Statistics of which 29 are designated as National Statistics.&nbsp; During the 2015\/16 financial year (01\/04\/15 to 31\/03\/16), NHS Digital published 294 statistical reports.

The Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) provides a legal framework for the lawful deprivation of liberty of those people who lack capacity to consent to arrangements made for their care or treatment. The legislation only covers individuals who are in hospitals or care homes and can only be authorised when it is assessed to be in the best interests of the individual concerned, to protect them from harm.&nbsp; The safeguards relate to adults aged 18 and over and only apply to individuals who have a mental health condition and lack the capacity to make specific decisions about their care.<br \/><br \/>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DoLS collection is mandatory for all councils in England. Applications that have not yet been processed are also analysed for completeness.<br \/><br \/>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Supreme Court judgement of 19 March 2014 in the case of &quot;Cheshire West&quot; marked a significant change to established practice, effectively lowering the threshold for what is considered to be a deprivation of liberty.<br \/><br \/>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Application status refers to whether the application has been 'completed' by the local authority and a decision has been made or not. Application outcome is whether the decision made was to grant a deprivation of liberty authorisation or not.<br \/><br \/>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For media enquires please contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:media@nhsdigital.nhs.net\">media@nhsdigital.nhs.net<\/a> or telephone 0300 30 33 888.<\/p><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"CTA\"--><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"COMPONENT\"--><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"UPPERBODY\"--><!--\/textbody-->","ARTICLEDISPLAYEDATE":"September, 28 2115 13:49:23 +0100","ARTICLEDISPLAY":"on","ARCHIVEDATE":"September, 28 2115 13:49:23 +0100","Media":[],"ARTICLEDISPLAYDATE":"September, 28 2016 13:49:23 +0100"}

It was won overall by the Division of Women's Health, King's Health Partners.<\/p><p>EPS enables prescriptions to be sent electronically from a GP surgery to a dispenser of the patients' choice and then on to the NHS Business Services Authority for payment. In 2014\/15, EPS made efficiency savings in excess of \u00a3115m. For prescribers, efficiencies include bulk signing repeat prescriptions, the ability to cancel prescription items and the reduction of lost prescriptions. Dispensers no longer need to transcribe paper prescription information. Standardised information reduces queries and the likelihood of the wrong medication being dispensed and makes the end of month claim process more efficient. Prescriptions are sent straight to the dispenser of choice, minimising patient collection time. EPS is now live at 6,212 GP practices (80%) and 11,620 pharmacies (98.6%). 18.8 million patients have chosen an EPS pharmacy and more than 47% of all prescriptions are EPS transmitted.<\/p><p>The HSJ Awards recognise and promote the finest achievements in the NHS, and showcase them to the service's most influential leaders.<\/p><p>Programme Head, Rachel Habergham, said:<\/p><p class=\"information\">&quot;We are delighted that the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) has received the accolade of highly commended at the HSJ Value in Healthcare Awards 2016. For the first time, EPS recently processed one million prescriptions electronically in a single day and the total number of electronic prescription items issued through EPS has hit 500 million. &nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"information\">With the ultimate aim of replacing written GP prescriptions, EPS seeks to drive efficiencies, save money, improve patient safety, and improve patient choice. Although we didn't quite win, we were a close runner-up and this is a reflection of the contribution that EPS is making to driving value in clinical services.&quot;<\/p><p>ENDS<\/p><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"CTA\"--><!--\/textbody--><!--textbody id=\"COMPONENT\"--><!--\/textbody-->","ARTICLEDISPLAYEDATE":"May, 31 2115 13:08:07 +0100","ARTICLEDISPLAY":"on","ARCHIVEDATE":"May, 31 2115 13:08:07 +0100","Media":[],"ARTICLEDISPLAYDATE":"May, 31 2016 13:08:07 +0100"}

And that's just what the newly formed HSCIC website project team recently did.<\/p><p>However this wasn't just any play session. It was part of training on the fundamentals of Agile and how it could applied to our project. This was really the first opportunity for members of the team to interact and work together as a functioning group.<\/p><h3>We built this city<\/h3><p>The second half of our day's training was probably the most memorable. It was certainly the most fun for me. Our team was given the task of building a themed city of our choice using the two massive bags of Lego pieces provide. After much deliberation and discussion we chose to build an amusement park city and were provided with the required list of the buildings and facilities. Each building was assigned a number of points representing the value that building would bring to the amusement park.<br \/><br \/>Out team was divided into two sub sets, the red and the blue. Each group was given a bag of Lego and had to collectively agree on what they would build. After the first five-minute 'sprint' it was, as you can imagine, total chaos and nothing substantial had been built.<\/p><p>However, as the day progressed we learnt what Agile really meant and the true capabilities of what we could accomplish.&nbsp; Our first learning was to work better as a coherent team, despite being split into two subgroups.&nbsp; We moved the two bags of Lego next to each other so we could better share the resources available. We spoke to each other more and assigned members specific tasks, like resourcing needed pieces.<\/p><h3>Three rides in one go<\/h3><p>We also found out early that some of the things we produced weren't what the 'product owner' wanted. Thereafter we checked his view on our ideas before wasting time building the wrong thing. Another fundamental learning was that some projects were too big to be completed at one go. We couldn't produce three amusement park rides in one five minute sprint, so we negotiated to produce them over more than one.<\/p><p>With each new sprint we learnt from our mistakes. We began to set more realistic expectations of what could be accomplished and got insights into members of the team's capacities. The process broke down many of the boundaries associated with putting together a team from different departments and geographic locations. Most importantly we learnt how we could work as a team using Agile methodology.<\/p><p>My proudest moment of the day was seeing the end result of our accomplishments - a ride, a carpark and some chalets. My lowest point was putting it all back in the bags.

Before a patient undergoes one of the four PROMs procedures, the provider should offer the patient a pre-operative PROMs questionnaire to complete. This should be completed between the date that the patient is determined to be fit and well enough to undergo surgery and the date the surgery actually takes place. Completion of the PROMs questionnaire is voluntary for the patient and their consent to participate must be granted for the data to be processed and used.<\/p><p>3. Post-operative questionnaires are sent out to patients three months (for groin hernia and varicose vein surgery) or six months (for hip and knee replacement surgery) after the procedure date recorded on their hospital record. For patients whose pre-operative questionnaire is not linked to a hospital record, the three- or six-month count is started 12 weeks after the scan date of the pre-operative questionnaire.

NHS Digital is the national information and technology provider for the health and care system. Our team of information analysis, technology and project management experts create, deliver and manage the crucial digital systems, services, products and standards upon which health and care professionals depend. Our vision is to harness the power of information and technology to make health and care better. NHS Digital is the new trading name for the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). We provide 'Information and Technology for better health and care'. Find out more about our role and remit at www.digital.nhs.uk<\/p><p>2. Data cover 1 April to 31 March each year.<\/p><p>3. From 2015-16 onwards the frequency and details of the HCHS complaints collection has been revised in both format and frequency (from annual to a quarterly publication). Because of these changes, data below an overall total figure are not comparable with earlier years. As a result of the changes, the 2015-16 HCHS data are classed as 'Experimental Statistics'.<\/p><p>4. 2015-16 is the third year that (FHS) data have been collected from individual practices and return rates are: 92 per cent GP and 87 per cent Dental practices. As these are similar rates to last year (94 per cent GP and 83 per cent Dental) we are able to make comparisons between these two years. However, differences between return rates for earlier years are too great to allow comparisons.<\/p><p>5. Factors affecting the number of written complaints an organisation receives include:<\/p><ul><li>Processes in place to resolve potential and verbal complaints before they escalate to written complaints. These include some organisations making staff available to discuss and resolve issues.<\/li><li>Staff making patients aware of other services, such as the Patient Advice and Liaison Service, known as PALS, which has been introduced to ensure that the NHS listens to patients, their relatives, carers and friends, and answers questions and resolves concerns as quickly as possible. They provide information about the NHS complaints procedure and how to get independent help if a further complaint is being considered.<\/li><li>Organisations have a responsibility to highlight the complaints procedures\/processes and alternatives to patients, through a variety of methods including leaflets, poster adverts and through direct discussions with patients. This better awareness of the written complaints process may lead to more patients complaining.<\/li><\/ul><p>6. The largest age band is 26 to 55-year-olds. This group made 25.0 per cent of all written complaints made, however 32.4 per cent of the total number of complaints made were made by or on behalf of people whose age was unknown.<\/p><p>7. The medical profession was the area that received the largest number of written complaints of all professions.<\/p><p>8. In the context of the HCHS-related written complaints: a complaint should be recorded and upheld if it relates to one specific issue and substantive evidence is found to support the complaint; a complaint should be recorded as partially upheld if it is made about several issues, and one or more, but not all are upheld; and a complaint should be recorded as not upheld if there is no evidence to support any aspects of the complaint made.<\/p><p>9. Upheld in this context means that if any or all of a complaint is well founded then it should be recorded as upheld locally. Data for the number of FHS written complaints that were partially upheld are currently unavailable. There is an aim to make these available in next year's annual publication.<\/p><p>10.
